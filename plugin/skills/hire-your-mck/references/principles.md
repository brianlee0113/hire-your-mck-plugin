# Slide principles

If principles conflict: **B > A > G**.

- **B** = the author's own rules from years as a McKinsey consultant. They always win.
- **A** = rules measured on 203 public McKinsey decks (3,257 pages, newer decks weighted more).
- **G** = widely known consulting practice (Minto, Zelazny).

`QA` says how `hire-your-mck check` tests the rule; *LLM* means you judge it yourself before rendering.

## B · The author's rules

**B-01 · The title alone gives the slide's point.** A reader who reads only the action title must get the full message. The body proves the title; it does not complete it.
QA (LLM): cover the body. Can you state the slide's conclusion from the title alone? Is there a conclusion in the body that the title lacks?

**B-02 · Reading order, and each region leads with its point.** Lay out top to bottom, left to right. Every panel, column or box opens with its own takeaway, then the detail.
QA (LLM): box and panel headers are takeaway sentences, not labels. Cause → effect, now → future, problem → solution run left to right. A takeaway sidebar sits to the right of its chart.

**B-03 · One slide, one topic.** Going deep on one point with several pieces of evidence is fine. Mixing different points is not.
QA (LLM): every element supports the same title. Panels of a multi-chart slide prove the same claim. If a number needs its own explanation (how it was calculated, what it assumes), move it to the next slide with its formula.

**B-04 · The executive summary alone tells the whole story.** It is the deck's lead messages in order.
QA: every exec item has supporting slides; every non-backup content slide belongs to exactly one exec item (spec ids).

**B-05 · Never show the same information twice on a slide.** A sidebar, callout, row or bottom line must add a new insight or a new data point. Restating what the chart or table shows wastes the space and reads as padding.
A plain sum, difference or remainder of numbers the exhibit shows (100% − 64%, 31% − 26%) is also a repeat: use the space for expected impact (with its basis), a driver, or a quote. The end page does not restate the executive summary: next steps only, unless `key_takeaways` say something new.
QA: fail if a sidebar or callout reuses a data_ref the body shows; warn if it is a plain sum/difference/remainder of body numbers, or if key takeaways overlap exec items. LLM: hide the body; does the sidebar sentence still tell you something new?

**B-06 · Never add unrelated information to fill space.** Everything beside the exhibit explains that exhibit: why the pattern happens, what drives each highlighted element, what it means for the decision. A metric that belongs on another chart breaks B-03 and B-01.
Numbers beside the exhibit are computed from it, but not as a plain sum or difference (B-05): shares and expected impact. QA: warn if a sidebar or callout number is not derived from body values. LLM: reading only the sidebar, is it obvious which part of the chart it explains?

**B-07 · The title gives the implication, not a readout.** State what the evidence means for the decision, and vary how the sentence carries it: put the implication in the subject ("Private label is our strongest profit lever, with 9 percentage points more margin"), lead with it before a colon ("Our core market is open: under 6% of the smallest firms use AI in accounting"), or let the fact imply it ("Phone check-in explains half of Riverside's extra wait"). Do not end every title on ", so …": none of 2,001 reference titles do, and 55% are a single clause. Reading the numbers off the chart is the reader's job.
QA (LLM): take the numbers out of the title. Is what remains a judgment (opportunity, risk, action)? If it only lists chart values, rewrite. Sweep every title in the deck.

**B-08 · Every estimate shows its basis, on the slide and in the workbook.** (1) An input from a source names the source on the slide. (2) A number we estimated shows its formula on the slide: number cards joined by operators (`basis` strip or `equation` body) or a `basis` line under a sidebar row. The workbook's Calculations sheet lists every assumption and holds a live Excel formula built from `calc`, not a pasted value.
QA: fail if `calc` does not recompute the value, if an `estimate` lacks `calc` or `assumptions`, or if a slide shows an estimate without its basis. Warn on derived numbers that read like estimates (projected, uplift) but are not marked.

**B-09 · Arrows only for cause → effect, exhibit → interpretation, steps → result.** Parallel evidence gets no arrow: two panels proving one claim, situation next to approach.
Renderer: no arrow between panels unless `connector: "arrow"`; case-example draws one only before Impact; the chart → takeaway sidebar chevron stays.

**B-10 · Every column has a header; every number says what it measures.** Lever and table columns carry headers (`headers: ["Move", "Why it matters"]`); a number in different units carries a `metric` line ("of shoppers say it is hard to find"). In sentences, name the subject: not "~$40M each" but "each of the two peers invested about $40M".
QA: fail if lever numbers have no headers, or mixed units have no metric. LLM: does every "each", "it", "this" point at something obvious?

**B-11 · A bullet reads on its own.** One sentence carries who or what, the metric, the value with its period, and the comparison: "Private label makes up 18% of our sales, against a US grocery average of 26%", not "18% vs. 26%". Lists use parallel grammar. Phrasing and units follow `style.md`.
QA (LLM): read one bullet alone; are subject, metric and comparison clear? `hire-your-mck check` tests the unit words.

**B-12 · A full deck leaves no "?" on the slides.** In `deck_detailed`, a placeholder is the last resort: ask the user as multiple choice with a recommended value and its basis first (benchmark, peer, or a calculation from sourced inputs shown as an estimate, B-08), then upload/paste, then a wider search. A target only the user can set is still a choice of 2–3 concrete values.
QA: warn when a `deck_detailed` spec still has placeholders.

## A · Measured on public decks

- **A-01** Numbers in the title appear on the slide (a total bar, highlighted bar, callout or sidebar). QA: title numbers are declared in `lead_message.numbers` with a data_ref shown in the body or sidebar.
- **A-02** Highlight only what the title names; everything else stays neutral. QA: chart `highlight` = title `highlights`; callout and statement emphasis must be words of the title.
- **A-03** Titles: 2 lines recommended; warn at 22–25 words or 3 lines; fail above 25 words. (Median 14 words; 90% ≤ 20.)
- **A-04** A count word in the title equals the number of elements ("three levers" = 3 rows).
- **A-05** A two-clause title ("X rose, while Y fell") gets a two-panel slide.
- **A-06** Chart slides carry a unit line: "**Metric**, unit, period".
- **A-07** Every number links to a source row. Derived numbers list their inputs and formula.
- **A-08** Exec summary numbering = section numbering; the tracker is generated from sections.
- **A-09** Successive titles connect ("However", "As a result") so the titles read as one story, but not through one template. Reference titles: 55% one clause, 13% colon, about 5% each dash, ", and", ", but"; none ", so". QA: warn when one connector shape is on more than a quarter of titles (", so" on more than a tenth) or on three titles in a row.
- **A-13** No slide type dominates. In reference decks of 15+ pages the most used type is 24% of pages at the median. Before settling on a type, check the routing rows for scatter (two measures move together), heatmap (many items × several measures) and framework. Statement pages are rare (1% of reference pages, mostly keynotes and vision documents): leave them out of analytical decks. Do not repeat a fixed label on every slide of a type (a "What drives it" on every KPI tile); vary it or leave it out. The sidebar `implication` box is for slides that lead to a decision, not every slide: most sidebars end on plain bullets; the renderer rotates four looks so one device does not repeat on every slide. QA: warn when one archetype is over 30% of a 15+ slide deck, or tables over 40%.
- **A-10** Reuse the same exhibit across parallel slides and move only the highlight.
- **A-11** The takeaway sidebar is the default for quantitative charts.
- **A-12** Density, matched to 2020+ decks: title 25 pt, body 14 pt, 0.6 in side margins, content down to 91% of the slide; 600–1,100 characters per content slide (charts ≥ 300); boxes 3–5 bullets; KPI tiles with 2–4 driver lines. Conclusion devices are chosen per slide (none 72% of reference pages, sidebar 17%, callout 7%, bottom bar 4%) and varied. QA warns on thin slides, lone charts, thin sidebars, one device on > 40% of slides or three in a row, callout tables without row notes, end pages without next steps. Sidebar value rows (label + number + bar) appear on at most a third of content slides and never on two in a row; QA warns otherwise.

## V · Source verification

A number is only as good as the line it was copied from. These rules make the source workbook something a reader can audit.

- **V-01 The value is in its excerpt.** Every web number carries a verbatim `excerpt`, and the value (or its rounding, with "billion", "%" and "percent" converted) appears in it. A value you computed from the excerpt is a derived number with `calc`, not a copied one. User numbers need an `excerpt` or a `locator` (sheet, row, page). QA: fail when a web number has no excerpt or does not match it; warn when the excerpt has no figure, or user numbers have neither excerpt nor locator.
- **V-02 Same definition.** The excerpt measures the same thing as the label: same currency, period, geography and population. A number in another currency is converted as a derived number (rate and date in `assumptions`). Use `period`, `geography` and `definition` when the label could mean more than one thing. QA: fail on a foreign-currency excerpt behind a `$` unit; warn when the excerpt names years and none is the data point's period. LLM: same population (all firms vs. employer firms), nominal vs. real, calendar vs. fiscal year.
- **V-03 Tier the source, cite the primary.** Every web source has a `tier`. **T1** primary: official statistics, regulators, filings, peer-reviewed papers, a company's own disclosures about itself. **T2** established research firms, industry bodies, reputable surveys. **T3** reporting on someone else's number (news, summaries, other decks): open the primary and cite it instead; if you cannot reach it, name it in `cites`. **T4** not citable for numbers: blogs, vendor marketing about a market, SEO statistics pages, AI-generated pages. QA: fail on a web source without tier or a number from T4; warn on T3 without `cites`, and on title or exec summary numbers that rest on T3.
- **V-04 Use the latest edition.** A web source has a `published` date; one published 4 or more years ago needs a newer edition or a `recency_ok` reason ("latest census; it runs every 5 years"). QA: warn.
- **V-05 Re-check the page before rendering.** `hire-your-mck verify` opens every web source again and looks for each excerpt (verbatim, near-verbatim with every figure intact, or for spreadsheets the row whose labels and column hold the value). It records `verified` {result: match, not_found or unreachable}. A person or an independent verifier who reads the page may override it (`by: "verifier"`). QA: warn on not_found and unreachable; in `deck_deep`, warn on web numbers never re-checked.
- **V-06 Two sources for the numbers the reader takes away.** In `deck_deep`, title and exec summary numbers get a second, independent source in `corroboration` (another publisher that does not cite the first). If the values differ by more than 2%, a note says which one is used and why. QA: fail when the second source is missing from sources, is the same source, or its value is not in its excerpt; warn on a dependent second source, a difference without a note, and (deck_deep) key numbers with one source.
- **Grades** (source workbook, column Grade): **A** T1/T2, re-checked, key numbers corroborated · **B** excerpt matches, not yet re-checked or one source · **C** T3, not found or unreachable on re-check, or sources disagree without a note; C numbers get a footnote on the slide · **E** our estimate (B-08).

## D · Deep decks (`deck_deep`)

A 30–60 slide deck is built with the seven-step process (Conn & McLean, *Bulletproof Problem Solving*) and laid out with the grammar of long public decks.

- **P-01 Define the problem first.** One sentence: outcome-focused, measurable, time-bound, at the highest level the decision maker owns. The worksheet names the decision maker, success criteria, deadline, accuracy needed and what is out of scope. The one-day answer has exactly three parts: situation, complication, resolution. QA: fail on an empty decision maker, success criteria, deadline or answer part; warn when the statement has no time frame or number.
- **T-01 Level-1 branches are the sections.** 3–5 kept branches, each a testable hypothesis, not a label; each maps to exactly one section, and each section to one exec summary item. Sections without a branch are context or how to make it happen. QA: fail on a branch count outside 3–5 or a branch without exactly one section; warn on label-like hypotheses or a section count that differs from the exec summary.
- **T-02 Prune on purpose, code what stays.** Every leaf is scored on importance × ability to influence. Big but unmovable branches get a `cut_reason` and appear on the appendix slide "what we did not pursue". Every kept node has a code ("2a"); evidence titles start with it. QA: fail on a missing or duplicate code, a title prefix that is not its code, or a slide that proves a pruned or non-leaf node; warn on unscored or low-scoring leaves and on pruned nodes missing from the appendix.
- **T-03 Every leaf is proven.** Each kept leaf has a workplan (analysis, dummied exhibit, candidate sources, knock-out first) and at least one evidence slide. QA: fail on a leaf without a slide; warn on a missing workplan or an evidence slide without `tree_node`.
- **T-04 The data rewrites the titles.** After the analysis, every leaf gets a verdict: confirmed, revised or refuted. A refuted or revised hypothesis never survives as a title; the governing thought and exec summary are rewritten from the verdicts. QA: fail when a refuted or revised leaf's slide still carries the hypothesis as its title; warn on filled leaves without a verdict or a verdict without a note.
- **L-01 Front matter is tiny; every section opens the same way.** At most 4 slides before the first section (cover, context, exec summary, agenda). Each section starts with the repeated agenda (or a divider), then a lead slide that states the section's answer and indexes its leaves, then coded evidence. QA: fail on more front matter, a section without a divider or a tree section without a lead slide; warn when the lead slide is not first or the deck is outside 30–60 slides.
- **L-02 Split long sections.** A section over ~20 slides gets sub-sections (`parent_id`) with their own tracker and lead slide. QA: warn.
- **L-03 The appendix mirrors the body.** 15–30% of a client diagnostic (up to 55% for a policy analysis, optional for a research report), in the order of the main sections: what we did not pursue, methodology, assumptions, "(1/2)" continuations. QA: warn.
- **L-04 Make it happen comes last.** Plan, owners and next steps are the last body section; a client diagnostic always has one. QA: warn.

## G · General practice

- **G-01 Horizontal logic.** The titles alone, in order, tell the story. QA (LLM): find the logic gaps.
- **G-02 Vertical logic.** Every element on a slide proves its title; drop what does not.
- **G-03 MECE.** Framework items, tree branches and levers do not overlap and leave nothing out.
- **G-04 Pyramid.** Exec summary (answer) → titles (arguments) → bodies (evidence).
- **G-05 One chart, one message.** The message picks the chart type, not the shape of the data.
